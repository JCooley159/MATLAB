function [ area, perimeter ] = rectangleMath( width, height )
%rectangleMath function to find the area and perimeter of any rectangle
%   uses basic geometric algorithms to find area and perimeter

area = width * height;
perimeter = 2*(width + height);

%These equations come from the basic geometry of a rectangle, and are given
%in the drill problem pdf.
